Some partnerships include Ai Weiwei × Jake Appelbaum (2015), Matthew Angelo Harrison x Trevor McFedries (2019) and Sarah Meyohas x Tarun Chitra (2019). Most notably, in 2014, Quantum, the [first-ever NFT](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/696336-first-nft), was minted publicly at a 7x7 event by Anil Dash and Kevin McCoy.
